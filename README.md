---------------------------------------------
Application listens to default port 8080, see application.properties.

Docs in JSON format are available at:
http://localhost:8080/store/api/api-docs

For yaml format:
http://localhost:8080/store/api/api-docs.yaml

Application info in JSON format: 
http://localhost:8080/store/
{"buildVersion":"23.0.0","buildName":"store-demo","buildDate":"2023-11-19 10:31"}

The application is not production ready, it's an example for bootstrapping an application with latest Spring Boot version: 
- setup and configuration
- security configuration
- persistence: entities, repositories, H2 in-memory database
- controllers for CRUD operations
- error handling
- testing
